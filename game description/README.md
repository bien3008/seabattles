# seabattle:

Sea Battle is a two-player game. The game is played on four grids, two for each player. The grids are usually square-shaped—often 10 × 10—and individual cells within the grid are identified by letters and numbers. On one grid, players arrange their ships and record the opponent's shots. On the other grid, players record their own shots.
